# >>>  Created and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 64-bits <<<
#
# This script installs PokemonGo-Maps including the Hash-server configuration.
# It will prompt you for the install folder and the hash key, and when it's done, it's ready to use! 
# You need all prerequisits you 'normally' would need for PokemonGo-Maps. I will add a more comprehensive script that takes care
# of everything, so you could almost install it on a clean Ubuntu machine.
#
# >>> BY THE WAY: IT USES PYTON VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
# >>> what?!
# >>> simply said: it installs all python packages and stuff in the cloned folder, instead of using the (shared) system ones.
# >>> some people don't like that. Because it takes soooooooooooooo much space. but i do like it. 
# >>> because it installs and uses all packages dedicated for- and IN the application's folder, so less conflics IMHO.
# >>> also less free diskspace, that's the catch. 
# >>> PogoMaps will take around 190 Mb using Virtual Env. That's the size of a 10 minutes HD video. Wohooooo
# >>> Just take out line 47 if you don't like it. If you REALLY don't like it, take out line 56 too.
